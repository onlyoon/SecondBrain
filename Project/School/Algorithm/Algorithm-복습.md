Algorithm
- A Step-by-Step method for solving a problem with doing a task

Commen Terms 
1. Variables: 
2. Data type: set of variables takes it values
3. Statement: line of code

Properties
1. input: algorithm uses values from a specific set { ... }
2. output: each input specifies the algorithm produces values from a specific task
3. precision: step precisely defined
4. correctness: input is defined for that output is correct
5. fitness: output after find num of step for each input
6. determinision: result should be guarenteed
7. generality: procedure apply to all problem not a special subset

Algorithm can be expressed in dillegent notation
-> natural language
-> pseudo code
-> flow chart notation
-> programming langguage
